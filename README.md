# WebHistory
[![BE Testing](https://github.com/htchan/WebHistory/actions/workflows/backend-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/htchan/WebHistory/actions/workflows/backend-test.yml)

## Background
If you will regularly go to websites to check if the content is updated, it maybe a waste of time when you load the website and find that there is no updates. This service can save your time to only reach to the websites with updated content

## Solution
This service will regularly loop registered websites and check if there is content update by pre-defined extractors for url hostname.

## TODO
- revamp FE
- enable the user version backend and try it on local
